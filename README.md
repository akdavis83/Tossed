The Native version uses [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for rendering. The Web version uses [zozlib.js](https://github.com/tsoding/zozlib.js) which is a simple reimplementation of a Subset of Raylib API in JavaScript for WebAssembly. The result is the same program [demo.c3](./demo.c3) works both Natively and in Browser without any direct modifications.
